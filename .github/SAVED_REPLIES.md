# Highfivery Saved Replies

In order to help reduce the time it takes to respond to open Issues and Pull Requests, we should leverage [GitHub’s Saved Replies](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-saved-replies) to help when we are continually responding in the same manner.  The following are various Saved Replies that the Highfivery team should use to respond to Issues and Pull Requests to ensure our community responses are similar and to minimize the amount of time crafting the same response to different requests.

Since GitHub currently does not allow us to have a repository-wide or organization-wide list of [saved replies](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-saved-replies/), these replies need to be maintained by individual team members.  Since the replies can be modified in the future, all responses are versioned to simplify the process of keeping the replies up to date.

While these Saved Replies attempt to give you the ability to quickly reply to Issues and Pull Requests, they are not meant to be the _exact_ response you should use every time.  Consider customizing them to fit the context of the Issue or Pull Request contribution you are replying to.  You will be best served by welcoming the contributor to the project (if its their first issue/PR), thanking them for their contribution, giving them context to your response (especially if you're closing their issue/PR), and noting next steps (e.g., issue milestoned for a specific release, open to them submitting a PR to resolve an issue, sending a PR to someone else to review).

You can add these saved replies to [your personal GitHub account here](https://github.com/settings/replies).
